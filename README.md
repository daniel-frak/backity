## Getting Started

First, [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github/cloning-a-repository)
this repository.

Then, build it locally with:

```shell
mvn clean install
```

You can run the project with the following command:

```shell
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=dev
```

As a result, you should be able to visit the home page on [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/):

## Profiles summary

The project can be built with various different profiles to allow for flexible configuration. Below you'll find a short
summary of the available profiles.

### Spring profiles

* `dev` - for local development. Allows things like handling requests from `http://localhost:4200/`.
* `angular` - special profile used for
  [client code generation](https://codesoapbox.dev/generate-client-code-from-spring-boot-using-maven/).
  Applied automatically when the `angular` Maven profile is enabled.

### Maven profiles

* `sonar-cloud` - for code analysis on push to `master`
* `code-coverage` - for including code coverage reports from the `backend` module during a sonar analysis
* `frontend-pre-sonar` - for including code coverage reports from the `frontend` module during a sonar analysis
* `frontend-sonar` - for running only a sonar analysis for the `frontend module`
* `angular` - for [generating client code](https://codesoapbox.dev/generate-client-code-from-spring-boot-using-maven/)

## API documentation

First, build and run the application. Then you'll be able to reach the API docs.

### Swagger

The Swagger UI page: [http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html).

### OpenAPI

The OpenAPI description is available at the following urls:

* [http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs](http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs) - in `json` format
* [http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs.yaml](http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs.yaml) - in `yml` format

## Client code generation

To run [client code generation](https://codesoapbox.dev/generate-client-code-from-spring-boot-using-maven/)
using the `openapi-generator-maven-plugin`, execute the following command:

```shell
mvn clean verify -Pangular -DskipTests
```

The application will be started so that the API specification can be obtained from the Open API endpoint.

The generated code will be available in the `frontend/src/main/angular/src/backend` directory.
**Don't edit those files manually.**

## Working with frontend on a local environment

If you want to see how changes you make in the frontend code affect the application you don't need to build it together
with the `backend` module every time. Use the following commands:

```shell
cd frontend/src/main/angular
ng serve
```

and visit [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/).
The application reloads automatically which speeds up your work.

In order to incorporate changes into the project, rebuild the whole application from the main project directory with:

```shell
mvn clean package
```

## Running test suites

### Backend

Run unit tests with the following command in the project directory:

```shell
mvn test
```

Run all tests with the following command in the project directory:

```shell
mvn verify
```

### Frontend

Run all tests for the Angular code with:

```
cd frontend/src/main/angular
ng test
```

## SonarQube analysis on a local environment

This project is configured so that its integration tests are taken into consideration when calculating code coverage.
SonarQube will show these tests as unit tests on the dashboard, as there is currently no native integration test support
within Sonar.

### Prerequisites

* You need to have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and
  [Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed.
* You need Chrome installed on your machine to run a frontend analysis with code coverage.

### Launching SonarQube on a local environment

To start a local instance of SonarQube, use the following command in the root of this repository:

```shell
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose_sonar.yml --env-file docker/.env up -d
```

You should only need to do this once.

The Java analysis profile is stored in `docker/sonarqube/java_profile.xml` and is automatically restored when first
launching the Docker instance.

The SonarQube instance will become available at http://localhost:9000. The default credentials are:

- User: admin
- Password: admin

To disable authentication, log in to the SonarQube instance, then:

1. Go to `Administration`.
2. Go to `Configuration`.
3. Go to the `Security` tab (on the sidebar).
4. Disable `Force user authentication`.
5. Click `save`.
6. Click on `Security`‚ûù`Global permissions` (on the top bar).
7. Toggle `Execute analysis` to ON for `Anyone`.
8. Toggle `Create projects` to ON for `Anyone`.

You can also
[generate a token](https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/user-guide/user-account/generating-and-using-tokens/#generating-a-token)
and use it as the value of `sonar.login` (omitting `sonar.password` entirely) when performing analysis.

### Full analysis

You can run analysis for the **whole project** (both backend and frontend) by running the following command from
the root of this repository:

```shell
mvn clean verify sonar:sonar -Pfrontend-pre-sonar
```

### Backend analysis

You can run a separate analysis for the **backend** module:

```shell
cd backend
mvn clean verify sonar:sonar -Pcode-coverage
```

### Frontend analysis

You can run a separate analysis for the **frontend** module:

```shell
cd frontend
mvn sonar:sonar -Pfrontend-pre-sonar
```

### Verifying results

Visit the [Projects](http://localhost:9000/projects) SonarQube page and choose the right project.

## Mutation testing

Mutation testing is the act of automatically modifying existing code in small ways, then checking if our tests will
fail. This project supports Java mutation testing through [Pitest](https://pitest.org/).
Bear in mind that mutation testing may take a while.

To generate a full mutation coverage report, use the command:

```shell
mvn clean test-compile -Ppitest-full
```

Navigate to `./backend/target/pit-reports` and open `index.html` to view the report.

The most efficient way to generate a local coverage report during development is:

```shell
mvn clean test-compile -Ppitest-new-code
```

This will only analyse code that has been changed compared to the `main` Git branch.
Note that the part retrieving `originBranch` might need to be written differently for Windows.

To use Pitest as part of Continuous Integration, use the following command in the CI script:

```shell
mvn clean test-compile -Ppitest-new-code -Ppitest-strict
```

This will fail the build if the mutation threshold is below a certain value.

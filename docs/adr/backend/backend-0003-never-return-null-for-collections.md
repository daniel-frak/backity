# Never Return NULL for Collection Types

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Returning `null` for collections increases the likelihood of `NullPointerException` errors
and requires defensive coding with null-checks.
This makes the code harder to maintain and more error-prone.

## Decision

- Methods, including those generated by `@Getter`, must not return `null` for collection types.
- If the underlying property of a collection getter is `null`,
  the method should return an empty collection (e.g., `emptyList()`).
- Pay extra attention to `null` values received from clients (e.g., REST API requests) - make sure the DTOs don't
  return `null` for collections

## Consequences

### Positive

- Eliminates many null-checks, simplifying code and reducing errors.
- Encourages robust, defensive programming practices.

### Negative

- Requires consistent developer discipline to enforce this rule.
